# AIoT Health: Medicine Reminder For The Elderly — Offline Voice-Interactive Medicine Adherence System

An ESP32-S3 based TinyML system designed to improve medication adherence 
in elderly patients, including those with dementia or Alzheimer's. The 
device runs entirely offline on ~$15 of hardware with no cloud dependency 
— a hard design constraint given the target users and deployment context.

Medication non-adherence causes ~125,000 deaths and over $100 billion in 
avoidable healthcare costs annually in the US alone. Existing solutions 
assume smartphones, stable internet, or active caregiver presence. This 
system assumes none of those.

## System Architecture

![Sytem Architecture](docs/methodology_block.jpg)

The full pipeline:

1. Alarm triggers at scheduled medication time via RTC
2. OLED display shows prompt, speaker plays pre-recorded TTS
3. User responds verbally
4. KWS model continuously monitors audio — detects medicine-related 
   command trigger
5. SLU model activates, classifies response into one of 8 intent 
   categories
6. Physical sensors cross-validate:
   - Hall effect sensor confirms pillbox lid was opened
   - Ultrasonic sensor confirms hand was placed inside
7. Based on combined result: adherence logged, caregiver email sent, 
   or reminder re-triggered
8. All inference runs locally on ESP32-S3 — no internet required 
   except for optional email notification

## Key Technical Details

**KWS Model**
- Architecture:2D CNN (Conv2D on MFE spectrogram features)
- Input: 49×40 MFE feature matrix
- Accuracy: 96.4%
- Inference latency: ~30ms on ESP32-S3 @ 240MHz
- Flash: ~0.7MB | SRAM: 130KB
- Quantization: int8 post-training, <2% accuracy drop vs float32

**SLU Model**
- Architecture: Embedding + GlobalAveragePooling + Dense
- Input: tokenized + padded text, vocab=1500, max_len=15
- Accuracy:  94.1%
- Inference latency: ~75ms
- Flash: ~1.1MB | SRAM: 200KB
- Quantization: int8 post-training

**8 Intent Categories**
| Intent | Example Input | Action |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| confirm_taken | "yes", "I took it" | Trigger sensor verification |
| deny_taken | "no", "I didn't" | Reschedule alarm |
| remind_later | "snooze", "30 minutes" | Postpone by extracted delay |
| ask_med_details | "which medicine?" | Read from medicine registry |
| ask_schedule | "when is my next dose?" | Read reminder queue |
| ask_time | "what time is it?" | RTC lookup + TTS |
| notify_sos | "help", "emergency" | Bypass confirmation, alert caregiver |
| irrelevant | out-of-scope queries | Confidence below threshold, do nothing |

**Hardware Constraints**
- Tensor arena allocated in PSRAM via EXT_RAM_BSS_ATTR
- Arena size tuned empirically — start high, reduce until stable
- MicroMutableOpResolver used (not AllOpsResolver) — registers only 
  ops the model actually uses, saving ~40KB SRAM

## Limitations

This system has real limitations documented honestly.  
See [LIMITATIONS_AND_FUTURE_WORK](LIMITATIONS_AND_FUTURE_WORK.md)

Core open problems:
- KWS and SLU trained on single speaker — degrades on unseen voices 
  and regional accents
- Firmware does not adapt dynamically to changing acoustic conditions
- Sensor alignment sensitive — misalignment causes false positives
- Real-world multi-user trial data not yet collected
