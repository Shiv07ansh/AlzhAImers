## About the System

**What does this system actually do?**  
A voice-interactive medicine reminder that runs entirely offline 
on a $12 microcontroller. It alarms, listens for the user's 
verbal response, classifies intent, and physically verifies 
that the medicine box was opened and accessed before confirming 
adherence. Full walkthrough: [interaction_flow.md](interaction_flow.md)

**Why does it need three forms of confirmation: voice, lid, 
and hand?**  
Voice confirmation alone is unreliable for cognitively impaired 
users who may say "yes" without actually taking medicine. 
Physical sensor cross-validation ensures the box was opened 
and accessed, not just verbally acknowledged. A single-signal 
system can be fooled by accident or confusion. The three-factor 
approach is the core reliability argument of the design. 
Full details in [interaction_flow.md](interaction_flow.md) , [state_machine.md](state_machine.md)

**Why does it work offline?**  
The target users such as elderly individuals in rural or low-income 
settings cannot be assumed to have stable internet. Cloud 
dependency would make the system fail precisely when and where 
it's needed most. All inference runs locally on ESP32-S3. 
WiFi is used only for optional caregiver email notifications.

**What happens if the user doesn't respond?**  
The alarm escalates, retried up to 3 times at 5-minute 
intervals. After 3 unacknowledged reminders, a missed-dose 
notification is sent to the caregiver. 
[interaction_flow.md](interaction_flow.md) — Alarm Escalation

**What if there's no WiFi?**  
Email notifications are disabled. All other functionality 
works normally alarms, voice interaction, sensor 
verification, and local logging to CSV on SD card. 

**What are the alerting fallbacks?**  
Primary: email via SMTP over WiFi  
Secondary: SMS via GSM module (SIM800L + TinyGSM) — 
works without WiFi  
Tertiary: local audible alarm (buzzer) — works without 
any connectivity

## About the Models

**Why two models instead of one?**  
A single end-to-end model doing both keyword detection and 
intent classification simultaneously exceeded the ESP32-S3's 
SRAM budget and introduced unacceptable latency. The two-stage 
cascade keeps KWS lightweight and always-on (~30ms, 130KB) 
while SLU only activates on trigger (~70ms, 200KB).  
Full details in [models/README.md](../models/README.md)

**Why does KWS use audio features but SLU uses text?**  
KWS is a binary audio detection task — MFE features work well 
and are computationally efficient. SLU is a semantic 
classification task, text representation normalises away 
speaker variation and noise that doesn't affect meaning. 
Different problems, different representations.  
Full details in: [models/README.md](../models/README.md)— Note on Architecture Divergence

**Why MFE instead of MFCC for KWS?**  
MFE avoids the DCT stage, making it computationally lighter 
with no meaningful accuracy difference for a binary detection 
task. More efficient for real-time inference on a 
resource-constrained MCU.
Full details in: [models/kws/training/README.md](../models/kws/training/README.md) — Feature Extraction

**Why int8 quantization?**  
float32 models exceed SRAM budget. uint8 showed more accuracy 
degradation than int8 on this dataset. int8 post-training 
quantization reduced model size by ~75% with less than 2% 
accuracy drop.  
Full details in: [models/kws/training/README.md](../models/kws/training/README.md) — Quantization Decision

**How accurate are the models?**  
KWS: 96.4% | SLU: 94.1% — both on controlled single-speaker 
test set. Performance on unseen speakers degrades and has 
not been formally benchmarked. This is the core limitation.  
Full details in: [models/kws/model_card.md](../models/kws/model_card.md), [models/slu/model_card.md](../models/slu/model_card.md) , 
[LIMITATIONS_AND_FUTURE_WORK.md](../LIMITATIONS_AND_FUTURE_WORK.md)

**Why does accuracy degrade on other people's voices?**  
Both models were trained primarily on a single speaker. 
The dataset lacked linguistic and acoustic diversity. 
Generalisation to unseen speakers, accents, and languages 
is the primary open research problem this work surfaces.

## About the Hardware

**Why ESP32-S3 specifically?**  
Vector extensions accelerate fixed-point convolution for 
quantized inference. External PSRAM support allows tensor 
arena allocation without exhausting internal SRAM. 
Deep-sleep sub-5µA enables battery operation.  
Full details in: [hardware_setup.md](hardware_setup.md) — MCU Selection Analysis

**Why does the HC-SR04 need a voltage divider?**  
HC-SR04 echo pin outputs 5V. ESP32-S3 GPIOs are 3.3V maximum. 
Direct connection damages the GPIO. The 10kΩ + 20kΩ divider 
brings echo output to 3.33V.  
Full details in: [hardware_setup.md](hardware_setup.md) — Voltage Level Shifting

**How was the ultrasonic threshold calibrated?**  
d_threshold = d_empty - 10mm  
Baseline d_empty measured when box is empty. Any distance 
reading 10mm below that baseline indicates hand insertion. 
Median filter over 5 readings prevents false positives.  
Full details in: [hardware_setup.md](hardware_setup.md) — Sensor Placement and Tuning

**Why is the hall effect sensor output sometimes unreliable?**  
Sensitive to magnet alignment — must be within 5mm tolerance 
of A3144 sensor face. Solved by epoxying components in place 
after positioning with a hardware jig.  
[hardware_setup.md](hardware_setup.md) — Sensor Alignment Sensitivity

**How much does the hardware cost?**  
Approximately $12.40 total BOM.

## About the Firmware

**How is the system flow controlled?**  
A four-state finite state machine: IDLE → AWAIT_SLU → 
AWAIT_LID → AWAIT_HAND → CONFIRMED. Each state has a 5s 
timeout that resets to IDLE.  
Full details: [state_machine.md](state_machine.md)

**Why is the tensor arena in PSRAM and not internal SRAM?**  
Both KWS and SLU arenas together with firmware exceed internal 
SRAM. PSRAM allocation via EXT_RAM_BSS_ATTR frees internal 
SRAM for the TFLM runtime stack.  
Full details in: [firmware/README.md](../firmware/README.md) — Tensor Arena

**How were the op resolver operators determined?**  
By reading the error codes thrown by micro_mutable_op_resolver.h 
at runtime — each missing op throws a specific error identifying 
exactly which op needs to be registered.  
Full details in: [firmware/README.md](../firmware/README.md) — Op Resolver
